ix1104 with one quad-core Xeon E3 3.3GHz CPU, 16GB RAM, 100GB SSD

Hosting:
 * mx.buildbot.net (MTA)
 * ns1.buildbot.net
 * syslog
 * backup
 * ldap

'syslog' is for all syslog information from every server, jail and service to
be forwarded to.

'backup' is meant for an Amanda installation.  There is an extra 160GB SSD
installed in that machine for fast backups and a DL Bluray (50gb/disc) burner
in it.

LDAP isn't something I was planning to setup for certain.  I'm doing it for
RTEMS because we have so many services it's a PITA to maintain different
accounts.  I'm going to be putting simple SSO software on register.rtems.org.
