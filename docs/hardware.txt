==========

ds0210.flosoft-servers.net
--------------------------

This is a rather ancient server that belongs to Mike Taylor (bear).

It is maintained by hand.
We need to migrate off of this server soon.

Hosting:
 * buildbot.net -- now just the www page, but with lots of redirects for old
   URLs
 * www.buildbot.net buildbot.org www.buildbot.org -- redirect to buildbot.net
 * buildbot.buildbot.net -- the metabuildbot
 * docs.buildbot.net
 * meetings.buildbot.net + supybot
 * rc.buildbot.net
 * a metabuildslave

At Amazon
=========

nine.buildbot.buildbot.net
--------------------------

This is an m3.medium that Dustin supports, running an older version of nine.

Hosting:
 * nine.buildbot.buildbot.net

At OSUOSL
=========

This is Buildbot's own hardware

service1
--------
ix1104 with one quad-core Xeon E3 3.3GHz CPU, 16GB RAM, 100GB SSD

Hosting:
 * mx.buildbot.net (MTA)
 * ns.buildbot.net
 * syslog
 * backup
 * ldap

'syslog' is for all syslog information from every server, jail and service to
be forwarded to.

'backup' is meant for an Amanda installation.  There is an extra 160GB SSD
installed in that machine for fast backups and a DL Bluray (50gb/disc) burner
in it.

LDAP isn't something I was planning to setup for certain.  I'm doing it for
RTEMS because we have so many services it's a PITA to maintain different
accounts.  I'm going to be putting simple SSO software on register.rtems.org.

service2
--------
ix1104 with one quad-core Xeon E3 3.3GHz CPU, 16GB RAM, 100GB SSD

Hosting:
