Topology
========

The other item about our setup is we currently live within the RTEMS protected
infrastructure.

That setup has dual redundant CISCO switches that are clustered and two
redundant firewalls running FreeBSD and PF.  They are using failover with
RSTP.

Each server in our network has one cable to each switch.  The firewalls have 4
ports to the OSL then two cables to each switch -- cross connected.  This way
we can lose one firewall and one switch (random!) and still have connectivity.
It also allows us to upgrade both without losing anything.

The network has been setup so Buildbot can move outside of the infrastructure
without losing anything.  We just move our cables and we're done.
